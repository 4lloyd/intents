When you post into a conversation endpoint, the result will give you a conversation ID.
You can re-post that ID in the future. Clients always store that ID. Up to backend to honor/use it.

- For query we want to respond with text.

Errors:
- What if slot has invalid value, like unknown color?
- Translatable sorry did not understand -> intent didn't match
- Translatable sorry couldn't find that area -> couldn't find area
- Translatable sorry couldn't find that device -> couldn't find device

Add success boolean. Watch should only show response if not succesful or if query.


Results are:
 - I did the work
 - I failed to do the work
 - Here is the information
 - Future: follow-up (conversation ID is important)

Type of conversation: query vs action.


Conversation endpoint:

text: <string> required
conversation_id: <string> optional
language: <string> optional, default to backend language
area: <string> optional (match first ID, then name)

Note: area is used for "required_context: area"


Response result:


type: action | query
success: true | false
response_text: "<string>"
conversation_id: "<string>" | null
